# Getting Help

We know how overwhelming all of this information can be. Here is some for asking questions and figuring out where to turn for help.

You can ask anything on the Slack #general channel, any time. Organizers and helpers are monitoring this channel, and some of your fellow hackweek participants may be able to help you! Also, feel free to send a direct message on Slack to any of the organizers or helpers. 

## Helpdesks

Apart from the helpdesk Slack channels listed below, you are also welcome to direct message the helpers if you don't feel comfortable asking questions publicly.

## During tutorials

**From Wu-Jung: I think we need to have a set intro each time we start a tutorial.  Here is how we will be asking questions, here is where to get help. If we can distill the intro into a few lines, we could have the presenter dock a tab with those instructions through their full talk.**

- Ask questions on Slack! Use the [#tutorials](https://app.slack.com/client/TUFFMB3EE/G018QH20KAM) channel to ask questions or check out answers to questions others have posed. We will use this same channel every day. Several of us will be monitoring this channel and addressing your questions throughout the tutorials
- Ask questions on the Slido page linked from the #tutorials channel (see the pinned message)
- **Vote up** questions from others to help the moderators prioritize which questions to ask the speaker during tutorials.
- Zoom Chat will **not** be available. Ask on Slack!
- You will be muted at the start of the tutorial presentation. The moderator will review questions on Slack and Slido, and ask the questions to the instructor during Q&A time.
